### Inspiration

The inspiration for the poems is middle english poetry, such as the Canterbury Tales. The poems are written in iambic pentameter, which is a common meter in english poetry. The poems are also written in rhyming couplets, which is also common in english poetry. They have themes of love, nature, and religion which evolved from the middle english poetry towards the renaisance period.

The Canterbury tales is a famous example listed below.

_Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote_
\
_When April with its sweet-smelling showers_

_The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,_
\
_Has pierced the drought of March to the root,_

_And bathed every veyne in swich licour_
\
_And bathed every vein in such liquid_

_Of which vertu engendred is the flour;_
\
_By which power the flower is created;_

These are the first four lines of the general prologue of the [Canterbury Tales](https://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/pages/text-and-translations).
